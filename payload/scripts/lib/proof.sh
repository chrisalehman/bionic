# payload/scripts/lib/proof.sh — the proof record (epic-23 wave-26 T4; REQ-3, D5).
#
# WHAT IT OWNS. One fact per proof: which commit a test pass or a review read. A proof is a
# line inside the plan's `## SDLC State`:
#
#     proved: kind=<floor|review|task> head=<40-hex> at=<ISO-UTC> evidence=<path under record/>
#
# written only by `session-poker.sh proof-add <kind> <evidence>` through the plan verbs'
# transaction, and read by `proof_last`. What is unproved is the difference since the head a
# proof names; `proof_state` (T5, beside these) is the reader that judges that difference.
#
# THE HEAD IS NEVER AN OPERAND, AND IT IS THE HEAD THE EVIDENCE READ (wave-26 T14; review 7 F1).
# `proof_attested` reads it out of the evidence itself — a full run's `head=<sha> dirty=<n>`
# header, or a review's `reviewed: <a>..<b>` line — and holds it against the checkout of the
# plan's `working-branch:`: a run must have read that checkout's head on a clean tree, a review
# a commit on its history. So a proof never names a head nobody tested, a dirty tree, or one
# that landed between the run and the verb, and a caller cannot type the head it wishes it had
# read.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Defines functions and one constant; reads nothing at load time.
# bash 3.2: no associative arrays, no `${var,,}`.
