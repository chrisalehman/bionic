Every factual claim in your report — a test result, a file's existence, a command's
outcome — carries the command that proves it and either its output or the path of a saved log
holding that output, or the explicit label `unverified`. The orchestrator re-checks an
`unverified` claim only when it acts on that claim; a claim with neither proof nor label is a
contract violation.

**Deliver the report with the SendMessage tool**, naming your artifact's path, to whoever
dispatched you (`to: "main"` unless your brief says otherwise). Completion is signaled,
never inferred: plain final text and going idle reach no one. Send it, then stop.
