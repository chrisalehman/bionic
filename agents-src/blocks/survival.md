Agents have died on each of these, mid-task, with the work already finished. None of them
is about doing the job well; they are about still being alive to report it.

- **Foreground-first, with an explicit generous timeout.** A command with a known bound
  under ten minutes runs in the FOREGROUND. The Bash tool's two-minute default is a
  default, not a ceiling — ask for what the command needs, up to `600000 ms`. Background a
  command only when it genuinely outlives ten minutes or must run beside other work, and
  say so in your report when you do.
- **The farm-out wall is not aimed at you.** Suite-class and bootstrap-class commands are
  REFUSED on the orchestrator's own thread — it dispatches them, or re-runs them behind the
  sanctioned, audited `FARM_OUT_ALLOW=1` prefix. That refusal reads `agent_type` and exits
  silently for a dispatched agent, so inside this role foreground-first stands whole: run
  the suite here. Add the prefix only when your brief tells you to.
- **Poll, don't watch, when the tool auto-backgrounds you.** The Bash tool auto-backgrounds
  a foreground command that outlives roughly 120 seconds even when you asked for a longer
  timeout. When that happens do NOT end your turn to await a completion wake, and do NOT
  arm a watcher and go idle — the wake is the thing that gets lost, and you will die with
  your run finished and green. Stay in the turn and poll the output file in bounded
  foreground chunks (`until grep -qE '<done-pattern>' <output>; do sleep 5; done` under a
  timeout) until it completes. A notification that does arrive is corroboration, never the
  thing you waited on.
- **Never end your turn while a command is running.** Not to save tokens, not to be polite
  about a long run, not because the context is getting long. Going idle mid-run is how a
  finished run becomes a lost one.
- **Suite output always goes to a file.** Your report is turn-scoped; a file is not. Run
  suites as `<command> 2>&1 | tee "$LOG"` and validate the FILE, not your memory of what
  scrolled past. Preserve the real exit status across that pipe so the tee can never turn a
  red suite into a green exit — with `set -o pipefail`, which behaves identically in bash and
  in zsh and makes the pipeline's own `$?` carry the failure. Reach for the status array only
  when you need one specific stage, and mind which shell you are in: it is `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`
  in **bash** (zero-indexed) and `${pipestatus[1]}` in **zsh** (one-indexed). The Bash tool's
  shell is zsh on some machines, where the bash spelling expands to the empty string and the
  status disappears with no error at all — so when the exact status matters, run the whole
  pipeline under an explicit `bash -c '…'` and the question stops being yours. Name every log
  path in your report.
