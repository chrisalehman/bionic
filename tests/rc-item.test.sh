# THE RC ITEM — epic-18 wave-03 slice 4/7 (spec §R6, AC-5, AC-6, AC-7).
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE OWNS. The `claude()` shell proxy as a SETUP-MANAGED ITEM: the
# marker-delimited block bionic owns in the user's shell rc, the roster and the
# write/read/delete in payload/scripts/lib/env.sh, the consented step in
# setup.sh that offers it, the row doctor.sh renders for it, and the strip
# remove.sh performs through both of its doors.
#
# WHY A SHELL FUNCTION AND NOT A LINE SOMEONE PASTES. `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
# has to reach the `claude` a person types, and the only place that can happen is
# their shell rc. A line written there by hand is footprint doctor cannot report
# and remove cannot strip; inside bionic's markers it is an item with an owner —
# offered once with a why, reported present or absent, and taken back out on
# request. That is the whole reason this file exists (Chris 2026-08-23: "It may
# only be made if it is permanently added").
#
# EVERY NEGATIVE HERE HAS A POSITIVE BESIDE IT, ON THE SAME EXTRACTOR AND THE
# SAME FIXTURE (.claude/rules test-authoring rule; memory
# `no-vacuous-tests-at-authoring`). `rc_block_lines` is asserted non-empty after
# a consented setup before it is asserted empty before one; the `type claude`
# readback is asserted to name a shell function after setup before it is
# asserted not to before setup. An extractor that returned the empty string for
# every input would fail the positive arm and take its negative twin with it.
#
# NO awk EQUALITY ON THE MARKER GLYPHS. The markers are box-drawing dashes, and
# an `awk '$0 == marker'` comparison on them is locale-dependent — it has
# silently matched nothing before. Every comparison below is bash's own `[ = ]`
# or a `case` pattern, in-process.
#
# ASSERTION-HELPER RACE. No `printf | grep -q` anywhere: containment is bash
# `case`, and the only reads of a file are bash `read` loops.
#
# HERMETIC. Every arm builds its own $HOME under $TMP, plants its own .zshrc,
# and points the payload at it with HOME/ZDOTDIR/SHELL/BIONIC_CLAUDE_HOME. The
# real ~/.zshrc is never read and never written. `claude` is a stub on a
# prepended PATH so no arm asks the live CLI anything.
#
# Usage: bash tests/rc-item.test.sh
# Registered by name in tests/run.sh (tests/*.test.sh is NOT auto-globbed).
