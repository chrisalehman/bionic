# CROSS-COMPONENT INSTRUMENT PROOFS — epic-15 wave-01R, slice 4/6.
#
# Serves AC-9 (N-way agreement over every copy of a duplicated concept,
# including the actively-maintained origin; one-copy mutation goes red) and the
# cross-script share of AC-8 (no command text in any written artefact;
# unpredictable temp names across all four scripts).
#
# Governing design: design/orchestrator-subagent-coordination.md §8, §9.
# Known-failure checklist: .bionic/docs/record/epic-15-w1r-known-failure-checklist.md
# A8 (duplicated logic with only a 2-way agreement test — the origin missing
# from the test meant to catch drift) and A9 (green suites hid undiscriminated
# parser edges: quoted values, absolute paths, duplicate directive lines,
# indentation — proven by a one-copy mutation staying green).
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR, and what it deliberately is not:
#
#   The per-script suites (hooks/{preflight-probe,dispatch-preflight,stop-check,
#   stop-guard}.test.sh) each drive ONE component against its own contract. Every
#   one of them is green while four byte-identical copies of active-wave
#   detection drift apart, because no single-component suite ever asks the other
#   copies the same question. This suite asks all four the SAME question with the
#   SAME fixture and compares the answers. It adds no per-component assertions.
#
# HERMETIC. Throwaway git repos under a mktemp'd sandbox; HOME and
# CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR redirected into it (the evidence gate appends findings under
# $HOME/.claude/logs — nothing here may touch the real one). No live wave, no
# installed hooks, no network.
#
# THE TWO ROOTS ARE DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT. `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is NOT
# `$HOME/.claude` here, because "where Claude Code stores session and project
# metadata" is computed at three sites in this wave and holding the two roots
# equal makes every disagreement between them invisible. That is not
# hypothetical: this file previously pinned the equal case, and behind it the
# observation resolved NOTHING while the recorder wrote a record and the stop
# gate spent it (Step-6 critic, issue 1). Every metadata fixture below is
# planted under $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, which is what the platform does when the
# variable is set; §C case 5 plants under $HOME/.claude and proves it is NOT
# seen.
#
# Usage: bash tests/cross-gate-agreement.test.sh
# Registered by name in tests/run.sh (tests/*.test.sh is NOT auto-globbed).

# ============================================================
# THE SHARED QUESTION
# ============================================================
#
# All three parties compute the same thing from a repo: resolve the docs root
# (honouring .bionic/config.yaml's `docs-root:`), select the newest plan two
# levels deep under plans/ and incidents/, read the fence-aware `## SDLC State`
# section through the CR-translating normalizer, and take its `current:` value.
#
# They then USE it differently, so the comparable observable is the predicate
# each can answer:
#
#     "does this repo present a plan whose `current:` names a valid step?"
#
#   dispatch-preflight  refuse (exit 2, no attestation planted)  <=> yes
#   stop-guard          refuse (exit 2, target unresolvable)     <=> yes
#   evidence-gate       "has no 'Step N:' line" (exit 2)         <=> yes, and N
#                       is the derived value itself — the only party that
#                       reports it, which is why the fixtures below are built so
#                       that a MIS-PARSE FLIPS THE PREDICATE rather than merely
#                       changing a value. A fixture whose mis-parse is invisible
#                       to two of three parties proves nothing about them (A9).
#
# Deliberately out of the battery, and why:
#   * `current: T<n>` — the two gates accept a task token unconditionally; the
#     evidence gate accepts it only on a `scale: task` plan and then exits 0 on a
#     valid ledger, so its answer to the predicate is unobservable there. Both
#     behaviours are conservative and deliberate; the asymmetry is pinned as a
#     KNOWN DIVERGENCE in section A3 rather than mixed into the agreement rows.
#   * The evidence gate's misplaced-plan sweep (`*.plan.md` carrying
#     canonical_sdlc_version outside the docs root) — a gate-specific rule with
#     no counterpart in the other two. Fixture plans are therefore named
#     `*.md`, not `*.plan.md`: every party's plan SELECTION matches `*.md`, so
#     nothing under test is weakened, and the sweep never fires to confound the
#     observable.
