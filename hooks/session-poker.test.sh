# Tests for hooks/session-poker.sh — the tick that decides whether a dispatched session

# Governing design: .bionic/docs/specs/epic-16-landing-contract/
# wave-02-fact-based-supervision.spec.md §Design ("Poker"). Serves AC-7 (arm/tick/noop/
# disarm at an accelerated clock) and AC-6's arrival half (a dead agent is reported at the
# next wake with no watcher process ever having existed) — this suite proves the REPORTING
# side of AC-6; the "no watcher process at any point" process-table bracket is AC-6's own
# live T3 arc and is not hermetic.
#
# Hermetic, same posture as hooks/session-sweeper.test.sh: every case runs inside a
# throwaway sandbox git repo. Nothing reads or writes the real .bionic/tmp, the real
# roster, or a live wave.
#
# CLOCK DISCIPLINE (house rule, carried from session-sweeper.test.sh): nothing here sleeps
# for a declared duration or interval. Launch times are roster fields (`iso_ago`), progress
# ages are mtimes (`backdate`), and the interval knob is driven small through a throwaway
# .bionic/config.yaml override — every threshold is fixture data, never a wait, and every
# override lives inside its own throwaway repo so nothing needs restoring at teardown.

section "Section 3: tick — the accelerated-clock decisions (AC-7, re-authored for the ack)"
# ============================================================
#
# AC-7's CONTRACT MOVED at epic-16 w2 Step-6 remediation R4 (cs review C-4), so this case
# list is re-authored rather than re-run: the ack is now an input to every decision below,
# and cases that used to read "an UNMET row past its duration NOTIFYs" now read "an UNACKED
# UNMET row past its duration NOTIFYs". Rerunning the old list green would have proven
# nothing about the property that changed.
#
# WHAT CHANGED. `acked=yes|no` rides beside the state on every verdict line
# (hooks/session-sweeper.sh:715), and three consumers already treated an acked row as
# closed — hooks/landing-gate.sh:214, hooks/stop-orders.sh:319, hooks/stop-guard.sh:491.
# The poker read the state alone, which made the sweeper's own closing sentence false:
#
#   hooks/session-sweeper.sh:817 — "an acked row is closed for every reader"
#
# It now is. An acked row is excluded from OPEN counting and from NOTIFY eligibility here
# exactly as it is there, which closes the two structural consequences C-4 named: DISARM
# was unreachable while any acked-UNMET row sat on the roster (the self-wake was immortal),
# and the NOTIFY set grew monotonically across a wave, re-alarming on work a human had
# already accounted for.
#
# The case list AC-7 is now driven by:
#   DISARM  — empty roster; every row MET; every row UNMET-but-ACKED (new).
#   NOTIFY  — an UNACKED UNMET row past its duration; a mixed roster naming only the
#             unacked overdue row (both paired positives for the exclusion above).
#   QUIET   — an UNMET row inside its duration; an unreadable duration; an ACKED overdue
#             row beside an unacked row that is not yet due (new).
#   REFUSE  — an absent roster (Section 5), unchanged by the ack.
#
# The ack reaches the poker on the verdict line it already parses, per row, and never from
# the ledger: the verb that owns the ledger is the verb that prints the answer (S9, and
# critic N-1's one-owner discipline).

# and its artifact — accounted for by a human rather than written to disk — will never
# appear. DISARM requires OPEN=0, so the self-wake could not be ended by the ordinary path
