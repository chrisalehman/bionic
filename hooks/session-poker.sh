# SESSION POKER — the tick that decides whether a dispatched session needs a nudge.
# Design: .bionic/docs/specs/epic-16-landing-contract/wave-02-fact-based-supervision.spec.md
#         §Design ("Poker"), succeeding epic-09/epic-10's resident cron poker — deliberately
#         NOT resurrected (spec §Rejected alternatives: "OS cron / launchd for the tick" is
#         residency in configuration form, ratified against).
# [WALL: tests/session-poker.test.sh]
#
# This is NOT a hook, exactly like hooks/session-sweeper.sh: it lives in hooks/ for
# test-harness pairing and to ride the payload's hooks/ directory into the mounted plugin.
# It is registered on NO channel — neither hooks/hooks.json nor a skill's frontmatter.
# It is invoked ON DEMAND, one question per invocation, and holds no process open:
#
#     bash <plugin-root>/hooks/session-poker.sh tick       one decision over this roster (read-only)
#     bash <plugin-root>/hooks/session-poker.sh arm        stamp the Patrol as alive, at engagement
#     bash <plugin-root>/hooks/session-poker.sh disarm     remove that stamp — this Patrol was ended on purpose
#     bash <plugin-root>/hooks/session-poker.sh interval   the configured Patrol interval, seconds
#     bash <plugin-root>/hooks/session-poker.sh adopt      what OTHER sessions launched here (read-only)
#
# `<plugin-root>` IS A PLACEHOLDER, NOT A SPELLING TO PASTE (epic-17 W5, spec AC-5). These
# are commands a MODEL types into its own shell, where `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is unset —
# the CLI substitutes that variable inside registered command files and nowhere else. The
# root is resolved ONCE PER SESSION, at Patrol arming, out of the CLI's own registry
# (`installed_plugins.json`, via `detect_plugin_root` in scripts/lib/detect.sh) and the
# resolved absolute path is baked into the session's own text from there on. The old
# `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude}` fallback is retired: it silently resolved to a
# bootstrap-era `~/.claude` copy that could be an older build than the installed plugin.
#
# WHAT IT IS. The poker is the decision brain of THE PATROL, not a resident process
# (spec R1). The doctrine that ARMS it lives in skills/canonical-sdlc/SKILL.md
# §Dispatch, and the mechanism is a session-scoped cron job: One clock per run, and only one.
# Arm it at engagement — never on dispatch, never one per unit — and then
# `CronDelete` the job at run close WITH `disarm` beside it, which removes the stamp: the
# cron half stops the firing and the stamp half is what says the stop was deliberate, and a
# `CronDelete` alone leaves a Patrol that every reader — hooks/patrol-revive.sh loudest —
# has to read as a death (critic C-2, epic-19 w1).
# Wakeups are recurring, never date-pinned: a one-shot
# `CronCreate` pinned to a wall-clock minute is banned, because
# a busy minute DROPS the tick rather than queuing it — so a one-shot whose single match
# minute finds the session working dies silently and never fires again. A run that needs a
# wake creates a SHORT RECURRING job and `CronDelete`s it on its first fire.
# Each Patrol tick delivers the patrol prompt, whose FIRST duty is `tick` and whose LAST is
# to continue the run's actual work rather than report on it; THIS SCRIPT DECIDES, the cron
# schedules. (Epic-17 W4 superseded the earlier mechanism, a harness self-wake primitive
# that slept `interval` seconds between calls; `interval` survives it as the cron's period.)
# `tick` is exactly ONE `verdict` read over the whole roster, plus — for any UNMET row only —
# a direct roster lookup of that one row's own `duration=`/`launched_at=` fields (verdict's
# own output carries neither). Never a per-row verdict call, never a second judgment of
# MET/UNMET/STILL-LIVE: that judgment belongs to `verdict` alone (ownership table,
# spec §Design) and this script only consumes it.
#
# WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never stops, kills, or notifies on its own authority. The
# decision is printed on stdout as ONE machine-readable line, and the caller (the patrol
# prompt the Patrol delivers) is what turns a NOTIFY line into an actual push. Zero
# authority, exactly like `verdict` (ADR-003).
#
# THE ONE THING IT DOES RECORD IS THAT IT RAN. Every invocation of `tick` and every `arm`
# writes a session-keyed Patrol stamp beside the roster — `.bionic/tmp/patrol-<sid>.state`,
# schema `patrol-stamp/v1` — and hooks/dispatch-preflight.sh refuses a dispatch when that
# stamp is absent (the Patrol was never armed) or older than 2x the poker-interval (it was
# armed and has stopped firing). Two properties make that wall honest, and both are pinned
# by tests/session-poker.test.sh §6:
#
#   THE STAMP IS WRITTEN BEFORE ANYTHING IS DECIDED — before the sibling sweeper is even
#   located, before the roster is read, before any exit path branches. What it attests is
#   FIRINGS LANDING, not decisions succeeding. A stamp written on success would measure the
#   wrong thing: this wave's own orchestrator session produced 10+ healthy-but-REFUSED
#   pre-roster ticks across one long interview, and stamp-on-success would have aged the
#   stamp into a false refusal of the wave's first dispatch. The single exception is a tick
#   with no session key at all, which has no stamp path to write.
#
#   `arm` EXISTS BECAUSE ARMING PRECEDES DISPATCH. The doctrine arms at engagement, never on
#   dispatch, so the first stamp cannot come from a tick that has a roster to read; without
#   this verb the wall is a chicken-and-egg that refuses every first dispatch of a run.
#   `arm` therefore needs no roster and asks for none.
#
#   `disarm` EXISTS BECAUSE A DELIBERATE STOP HAS TO BE READABLE. It removes the stamp, and
#   nothing else in production ever did — so an aging stamp meant "the Patrol died" and
#   "the run ended its own Patrol" indistinguishably, and hooks/patrol-revive.sh reported
#   the second as the first on EVERY remaining turn of the session (critic C-2, epic-19 w1).
#   Its two callers are the two deliberate stops there are: the run-close ritual in
#   skills/canonical-sdlc/SKILL.md §Dispatch, beside the `CronDelete`, and the DISARM
#   decision below, which takes it as the last act of its own tick.
#
# The stamp is a LIVENESS signal, not an authority: it says the Patrol fired, and it cannot
# say the CLI's cron table still holds the job. That honest limit is the wall's too.
#
# AN ACKED ROW IS CLOSED HERE, exactly as it is for the other three consumers of the
# verdict line (hooks/landing-gate.sh, hooks/stop-orders.sh, hooks/stop-guard.sh): it is
# neither open nor notifiable. `acked=` is read PER ROW off the verdict line below, never
# from the ledger — the verb that owns the ledger is the verb that prints the answer.
#
# DECISIONS, in precedence order:
#   DISARM   the roster carries no OPEN row — an empty roster (spec's "disarmed on empty
#            roster" invariant, literally) generalizes here to the roster having nothing
#            open at all: every row MET, WAIVED or ACKED is the same "nothing left to wait
#            for" as no rows existing, so all read DISARM (S2 design decision plus epic-16
#            w2 Step-6 remediation R4, both logged to the plan). A DISARM tick REMOVES this
#            session's stamp as its last act — the decision is terminal, so the disk record
#            that a Patrol runs here has to stop saying so — except on a tick that also
#            found the dispatch wall blind, where the wall-blind NOTIFY outranks the DISARM
#            and the stamp stays.
#   NOTIFY   at least one UNACKED UNMET row's elapsed time (now − launched_at) exceeds its own
#            declared `duration=`, read by the same parser `verdict` uses for `cadence=`
#            (hooks/session-sweeper.sh's parse_seconds, duplicated below — see that file's
#            fix, same commit lineage, epic-16 w2 S2). A row whose duration is unreadable or
#            whose launch time is unreadable is skipped, never guessed at — the same
#            "refuse rather than invent" rule verdict itself follows.
#   QUIET    open rows exist (UNMET-not-past-duration, STILL-LIVE, or AMBIGUOUS) but none
#            qualify for NOTIFY — the tick ran, found nothing to say, and that is reported.
#
# Exit codes mirror hooks/session-sweeper.sh's verdict verb, because a caller already knows
# how to branch on this shape:
#   0 — DISARM or QUIET
#   1 — NOTIFY (something needs surfacing)
#   2 — usage error, or a refusal (propagated from the sweeper read, or raised here)
#   3 — no session key
#
# Session key: CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, exactly as hooks/session-sweeper.sh takes it.
#
# THE SWEEPER IS THIS SCRIPT'S SIBLING, resolved exactly as hooks/landing-gate.sh resolves
# it: no PATH lookup (a hook's PATH is not ours to trust), no environment override (a seam on
# the path under test would leave the production path unverified) — so the same resolution
# holds in the repo and under the mounted plugin's hooks/, which ships both side by side.
# Registered on no channel — invoked on demand from the mounted plugin payload.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the blind wall
#
# THE WALL THAT ROSTERS A DISPATCH IS REGISTERED ON THE SKILL CHANNEL, not in hooks.json:
# skills/canonical-sdlc/SKILL.md's own frontmatter registers hooks/dispatch-preflight.sh
# (that partition is deliberate — the wall is armed-scoped, not always-on). A skill-channel
# registration lives in the process's `sessionHooks` table and does NOT survive a session
# continue, a `/clear`+resume, or `/reload-plugins`. When it is gone, NOTHING SAYS SO:
# dispatches launch normally, no row is written, and the first symptom is a tick REFUSING
# with "no roster" — which reads as "nothing has been dispatched yet", the exact opposite of
# what happened. Measured live 2026-08-22; the same symptom is recorded unresolved at
# .bionic/docs/record/session-20260814-wave-detector-terminal-state/min-interactive-agent-hook.md
# §6, and the cure proven the same day is to re-invoke the skill in the same process.
#
# So the tick — which already runs inside the session and already holds its session id —
# compares TWO records of the same event:
#
#   the transcript, which the CLI writes whatever the hooks do:  every `Agent` tool_use
#   the roster,     which only the wall writes:                  every dispatch it saw
#
# A gap between them is the wall's absence, observed rather than assumed. This is a
# DIAGNOSIS, not a gate: it never refuses anything, and it never touches the roster.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COUNTED, each because counting it would make a live wall look
# blind: a tool_use inside an agent context (`isSidechain`, or an explicit agent key) — a

# file read into context) inflates the refusal count, which suppresses rather than raises.

# liveness question (`roster_session_live`): a session's transcript is `<sid>.jsonl` under
# some project directory of CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects. Not resolvable means SILENT — a

# A REFUSAL IS A JOIN, NOT A LITERAL. `PreToolUse:Agent hook error:` is what the CLI writes
# into a refused dispatch's tool_result — and it is ordinary text everywhere else. The plan
# that specifies this check, the reviews of it and every brief that quotes it carry the
# literal, so reading one of those files puts the marker in a tool_result of THAT read, and
# a transcript-wide grep for it counted 19 refusals in the session that wrote this line
# against a truth of 1 — the detector inert in the repository that builds it. So the marker
# is credited only where it joins BY tool_use_id to an `Agent` tool_use of this thread: the
# refused dispatch's own result. payload/scripts/lib/patrol.sh applies the identical rule
# for doctor's reconstruction, and tests/cross-gate-agreement.test.sh §Q asks both copies
# the same fixture and compares their two answers to each other.
#
# TWO REGIONS OF THE LINE, and only one of them is the result. Beside `message` the CLI
# writes a sibling `toolUseResult` field restating the same result — and for a SPAWN it
# writes the whole brief there, so a brief that quotes the marker (this one does) plants
# one on a successful dispatch's own line. The scan therefore stops at that key: `message`
# precedes it on every entry this machine has written (34k records, 0 counterexamples), and
# a tool_result never appears twice in one entry, which is what lets one line credit at
# most one refusal. If the CLI ever reorders those keys this over-credits again rather than
# going quiet — §Q's spawn-echo fixture is what would say so.

#
# WHAT A `/clear`+RESUME ACTUALLY LOSES, and what it does not. Lost: the completion message
# (the CLI delivers it to the conversation that dispatched, and that conversation is gone)
# and the orchestrator's in-memory dispatch ledger. NOT lost: the agent itself — same
# process, still working — its artifacts, its transcript under
# `<config>/projects/<slug>/<old-sid>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, and its roster row, which
# lives in the PROJECT's `.bionic/tmp` rather than in any session.
#
# So the successor session can read every one of those files and still be unable to ACT on
# the agent, because the one thing it cannot re-derive is the AGENT ID — the identity the
# CLI handed back at launch and only the dead conversation held. `SendMessage` and
# `TaskStop` both take it, and hooks/stop-guard.sh refuses a stop by NAME for exactly this
# reason ("a NAME is not an identity — it is reused across waves"), naming the full agent id
# as the deliberate way through. The id is on disk the whole time: hooks/execution-recorder.sh
# writes it onto the row as `status=identified|agent_id=`.
#
# `adopt` is the verb that reads it back. For every roster in this project's `.bionic/tmp`
# that belongs to some OTHER session, it prints each row that is still open, its id, and the
# three addresses derived from that id — observe, message, stop — plus a verdict taken from
# disk rather than from memory.
#
# IT WRITES EXACTLY ONE THING, AND IT IS THIS SESSION'S OWN ROSTER. Everything else this
# verb touches is read: no PREDECESSOR roster is ever written (that session may still be
# appending to it), no Patrol stamp is taken (this is not a tick and must not age the
# arming wall's clock), and nothing is stopped or messaged.
#
# The one write is the adoption itself, and it exists because printing an id was only half
# a cure (epic-20 W1 B-1). Every wall downstream of the id asks THIS session's roster
# whether the agent is ours — hooks/stop-guard.sh establishes ownership from a
# `confirmed`/`identified` row carrying the resolved id, hooks/stop-check.sh classifies
# from the same accepted set — so with no row of ours the predecessor's agent classifies
# FOREIGN and every stop of it is refused. `adopt_write_row` below is the successor saying
# on disk what this verb has just said on the terminal: this contract is mine now.
#
# THIS SESSION'S OWN ROWS ARE NEVER ADOPTED. They are not lost — the running session still
# holds them — and printing them would invite the successor to re-ledger work it is already
# tracking, which is the double-counting the roster exists to prevent.

# `<config>/projects/<slug>/<sid>/subagents` — the same walk session_transcript does, one
# level deeper, and keyed on the DIRECTORY rather than the session's own `.jsonl`: an old
# session's transcript can be reclaimed while its agents' files survive, and the agents are

# ONE FOLD PER PREDECESSOR ROSTER, and the same rule the fleet's other three folds keep: the
# file is append-only, a contract advances along it (`intended` -> `confirmed` ->
# `identified`), every writer copies the contract fields forward, so the LAST row carrying a
# name is the authoritative one (tests/cross-gate-agreement.test.sh §P). Two departures,
# both because this fold answers a question the others do not:
#
#   THE ID IS TAKEN OFF `identified`/`confirmed` ONLY, never off `intended` — the same
#   accepted set hooks/stop-guard.sh and hooks/stop-check.sh use for ownership, and for the
#   same reason: `intended` carries `agent_id=` empty by design, and a row that never
#   advanced past it has no identity to offer. That row is the UNADDRESSABLE case, reported
#   with its cure rather than skipped, because a silent skip is how a predecessor's agent
#   becomes invisible twice.
#
#   A ROW IS CLOSED BY A LANDED MARKER OR BY AN ACK, and by nothing else. `landing-swept/v1`
#   with `state=MET` is hooks/landing-gate.sh saying the contract landed; the ack ledger is
#   the orchestrator saying so by hand, and the sweeper's own ledger comment already binds
#   it across sessions ("an ack taken in a session that has since died is still in force in
#   its successor"). A `landing-swept` marker reading UNMET closes NOTHING here: an answered
#   failure is exactly the row a resumed session most needs to see.
#
# Output is one `|`-delimited record per open row. `|` rather than a tab because every value
# on a roster row is cleaned of `|` at write time, while the shell collapses runs of tabs
# and would silently merge two empty fields into one.

# THE ADOPTED ROW — the verb's one write, and the second half of the B-1 cure. What it

#                       establish ownership BY ID from. `confirmed` would do as well and
#                       says less: the id is known, which is exactly what `identified` means.
#   agent_id=           the TRANSCRIPT form, the only form either gate resolves a target to.
#   teammate_id=        the ADDRESSING form `<name>@session-<id8>`, the only spelling the
#                       platform's stop primitive takes for a teammate — built for THIS
#                       session, because this session is the one that now holds the row and
#                       hooks/stop-guard.sh reads the recorded address before it constructs
#                       one. A predecessor's row may carry no teammate_id at all.
#   adopted_from=       provenance. The agent is still filed under the predecessor's own
#                       subagents directory, and that directory is what hooks/stop-guard.sh
#                       must widen its resolution to; without this field it cannot know
#                       which session to widen to, and a blind project-wide walk is exactly

# header-if-absent, `chmod 600`, ONE `printf` of one line, NO LOCK. A single O_APPEND write
# of well under a pipe buffer is not interleaved by the kernel; a read-modify-write here

# IDEMPOTENT BY READ-BEFORE-APPEND. `adopt` is the first verb a resumed session runs and it
# is run again at the next resume, so a row already carrying this agent's id AND a
# provenance is left alone — otherwise the roster would grow one row per run without
